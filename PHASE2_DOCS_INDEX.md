## 🎓 KEY INSIGHTS ACROSS ALL DOCUMENTS

### Honest Reporting Philosophy
- ✅ All 10 classes in main evaluation (no merging)
- ✅ Rare-class failures acknowledged (48-50% is realistic)
- ✅ Bootstrap CIs reported (acknowledge uncertainty)
- ✅ Limitations section required (critical for acceptance)
- ✅ Merged-class only shown as ablation

### Compression Degradation Pattern
- ✅ Common attacks (DDoS, PortScan): -1-2% recall acceptable
- ✅ Rare attacks (Bot, SSH): -15-20% recall expected ⚠️
- ✅ Model size: 99% reduction (7.6MB → 48KB)
- ✅ Latency: 53% improvement (15ms → 7ms)

### Why Knowledge Distillation Matters
- ✅ Student baseline: 50% rare-class recall
- ✅ KD student: 65% rare-class recall (+15% ⭐)
- ✅ This improvement is your strongest evidence

### Why Holdout Evaluation Matters
- ✅ Track degradation across every compression stage
- ✅ Final honest metric: holdout recall on never-seen samples
- ✅ Shows exactly when and how compression hurts
